random development notes

- need to fix the scheduled sending bug where it sends multiple times
- users complaining about image quality, maybe increase default quality
- consider adding support for other file formats like epub
- the database gets pretty big with lots of users, maybe switch to sqlite
- rate limiting might be too strict for power users
- keyboard layout could be better organized
- error messages are in russian and english randomly, should be consistent
- cleanup job runs too often, maybe change to weekly instead of daily
- achievement system is pretty basic, could add more interesting achievements
- logging is too verbose in production, dial it down
- dockerfile needs updating, python version is old
- tests are flaky sometimes, especially the async ones
- backup feature is manual only, should automate it
- admin commands need better access control
- pdf parsing fails on some encrypted files
- memory usage grows over time, probably a leak somewhere
- telegram bot api changes broke some functionality recently

TODO:
[ ] fix memory leak in pdf processing
[ ] add epub support  
[ ] better error handling for corrupted files
[ ] move to postgresql for better performance
[ ] add user feedback system
[ ] implement proper CI/CD pipeline
[ ] write more comprehensive tests
[ ] add monitoring and alerting
[ ] optimize image compression
[ ] add dark mode for messages (lol not really possible but would be cool)

bugs to fix eventually:
- scheduler sometimes skips days
- file uploads fail randomly
- bot crashes on very large pdfs
- user settings don't persist sometimes
- achievements unlock incorrectly
- leaderboard calculation is wrong

random ideas:
- book recommendations based on reading history
- social features like sharing progress
- reading groups or book clubs
- integration with goodreads
- voice narration (probably too expensive)
- mobile app companion
- web dashboard for admins
- better analytics and insights
