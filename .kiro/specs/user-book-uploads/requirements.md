# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will implement a comprehensive user-specific book upload system for the PDF Sender Bot, allowing each user to upload and manage their own personal library of PDF books. The system will replace the current single-book approach with a multi-user, multi-book architecture backed by a proper database instead of JSON file storage.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload my own PDF books to the bot, so that I can have a personalized reading experience with my chosen books.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a PDF file to the bot THEN the system SHALL validate the file format and size
2. WHEN a valid PDF is uploaded THEN the system SHALL store it in a user-specific directory structure
3. WHEN a PDF is successfully uploaded THEN the system SHALL extract metadata (title, page count) and store it in the database
4. WHEN a user uploads a book THEN the system SHALL assign a unique identifier to the book for that user
5. IF a user uploads a book with the same name THEN the system SHALL handle duplicates by appending a version number

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage multiple books in my personal library, so that I can switch between different reading materials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests their book list THEN the system SHALL display all books they have uploaded with metadata
2. WHEN a user selects a book from their library THEN the system SHALL set it as their active reading book
3. WHEN a user wants to delete a book THEN the system SHALL remove it from their library and clean up associated files
4. WHEN a user has multiple books THEN the system SHALL maintain separate reading progress for each book
5. IF a user has no books uploaded THEN the system SHALL prompt them to upload their first book

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want my reading progress to be maintained separately for each book, so that I can read multiple books simultaneously without losing my place.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user switches between books THEN the system SHALL preserve the current page for each book independently
2. WHEN a user requests the next page THEN the system SHALL deliver the correct page from their currently active book
3. WHEN a user sets a reading schedule THEN the system SHALL apply it to their currently active book
4. WHEN a user completes a book THEN the system SHALL mark it as finished and update their reading statistics
5. IF a user hasn't selected an active book THEN the system SHALL prompt them to choose from their library

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the bot to use a proper database instead of JSON files, so that data integrity and performance are maintained as the user base grows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL connect to a SQLite/PostgreSQL database
2. WHEN user data is modified THEN the system SHALL use database transactions to ensure data consistency
3. WHEN the system stores user information THEN it SHALL use proper database schemas with relationships
4. WHEN the database is queried THEN the system SHALL use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
5. IF the database connection fails THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling and retry logic

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want my uploaded books to be secure and private, so that only I can access my personal library.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a book THEN the system SHALL store it in a user-specific secure directory
2. WHEN a user requests book operations THEN the system SHALL verify they own the book before allowing access
3. WHEN files are stored THEN the system SHALL use proper file permissions to prevent unauthorized access
4. WHEN a user is deleted THEN the system SHALL clean up all their associated files and data
5. IF an unauthorized access attempt occurs THEN the system SHALL log the incident and deny access

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive helpful feedback during book upload and management, so that I understand what's happening and can resolve any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads an invalid file THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages explaining the issue
2. WHEN a book upload is in progress THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators
3. WHEN a book operation completes successfully THEN the system SHALL confirm the action with relevant details
4. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL provide actionable guidance for resolution
5. IF the system is processing a large file THEN it SHALL inform the user about expected wait times

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the bot to handle large PDF files efficiently, so that I can upload books of any reasonable size without performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a large PDF THEN the system SHALL process it asynchronously without blocking other operations
2. WHEN processing a PDF THEN the system SHALL implement memory-efficient page extraction
3. WHEN storing files THEN the system SHALL compress images appropriately to save storage space
4. WHEN a user requests pages THEN the system SHALL deliver them quickly regardless of book size
5. IF a file is too large THEN the system SHALL reject it with clear size limit information
